## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This solution could have been a lot shorter, but I wanted to be more pristine. My css file is quite long considering the challenge is a simple one.

### Useful resources

- https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples - This helped me for the box shadow 'cos I can't be bothered to create a custom one and I really like their collection.
